# Final_Project_Ironhack

**Website Conversion**

My dataset stems from the company Vandelay Industries and refers to the visitors of their website. The dataset is available on github.com (https://github.com/jainds/eda-for-conversion-rate-dataset) and consits of 316.200 x 6 rows and columns. 

The sheet is cleaned up already, containing no nulls so far. The goal of the project will be to determine the conversion rate of the website based on the both numerical and categorical features:
- age,
- country,
- new_user,
- source,
- total_pages_visited and
- conversion 

and to give recomendations for the product or marketing  team.

The project shall consist of a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). After that, given that the target variable is binary ('Conversion') I will work with the corresponding classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression etc) and compare the results based on their accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Finally I will consider to represent the findings in Tableau as well.

Challenges may be imbalance of data, scaling if needed based on the model, finding  the right model, interpreting it correctly and presenting the findings in an easy-to-understand way. 

**Submission**
I will hand in a clean and structured jupyter notebook and potentially a tableau dashboard that illustrates the most important findings.
